# Student visualizations, code and polls

These are visualizations that students uploaded for the "mobility trajectory" assignment (see main Read Me and course instructions for the description).

Some have shared their scripts and replication code for their visualization. Credit is all theirs and if you wish to contact them, please look up their names (printed above each visualization) and find them.
