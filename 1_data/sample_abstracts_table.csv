Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye. Author summary During the development of the brain, visual cortex has a period of increased plasticity. Closing one eye for multiple days during this period can have a profound and life-long impact on neuronal responses. A well-established hypothesis is that the absolute level of inhibition regulates this period. In light of recent experimental results, we suggest an alternative theory. We propose that, in addition to the level of inhibition, synaptic plasticity onto inhibitory neurons is just as crucial. We propose a model which explains many observed phenomena into one single framework. Unlike theories considering only the level of inhibition, we can account for both the onset as well as the closure of this period. Furthermore, we also provide an explanation for the small fraction of neurons that show counter-intuitive behaviour and provide some testable predictions."

We measured the PAS-induced plasticity in the primary motor cortex. Blood levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), estradiol, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone, and the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) were determined in 15 healthy men and 20 healthy women. We observed an age-related reduction of PAS-induced plasticity in females that it is not present in males. In females, PAS-induced plasticity displayed a correlation with testosterone (p = 0.006) that became a trend after the adjustment for the age effect (p = 0.078). In males, IGF-1 showed a nominally significant correlation with the PAS-induced plasticity (p = 0.043). In conclusion, we observed that hormone blood levels (testosterone in females and IGF-1 in males) may be involved in the age-dependence of brain plasticity."

Vital and functional prognosis of a cohort of 78 patients followed during 2.5 years","Purpose of the study The purpose of this study was to highlight factors influencing vital and functional prognosis at. 2.5 years of elderly people being treated for a proximal femoral fracture. Material The study was based on 78 patients more than 75 years old admitted to the orthopedic department for emergency treatment. After post-operative care, patients were transferred to a geriatric readaptation unit. The average patient age at the time of surgery was 85 years. Methods This was a retrospective study. Survival graphs were established for the entire population as well as for the sub-populations characterized by a studied parameter. Mortality factors were compared via a univariable analysis. A multivariable logistical regression analysis isolated the factors explaining mortality at 12, 18, and 30 months and survival at 30 months, as well as factors explaining functional prognosis at 1 year. Results The overall mortality rate was 41 per cent, 48.5 per Gent of deaths occur within the first year. Factors which are harmful for vital prognosis are the following : high degree of dependence before the fracture, the existence of a neuropsychiatric pathology, and age factor (more than 85 years). 61.5 per cent of surviving patients were independent for daily activities. 77 per cent of surviving patients lived in their usual place of residence. Factors which were harmful for functional prognosis were the following : type of the fall, symptomatic of an underlying pathological stale, and existence of a neuropsychiatric pathology. Nutrition was also a predictive factor concerning the patient's out come. Discussion The average age of the studied population was higher than in most studies in literature. The treatment is mainly based on hip arthroplasty. The group of patients of over 85 have the highest mortality rate, However, a better survival rate at 18 months has been observed for patients older than 90 years, The delay before surgical care was significantly negative if longer than 6 days, However, a delay of 3 to 6 days was not significantly harmful for survival. Within the studied population, the maximum autonomy gain was observed during the first 6 months. The type of nan-accidental fall, symptomatic of an associated pathology, was a factor for functional prognosis which has not been often mentioned. So was the biological deficit of nutrition. Social status acted as an indicator of functional status evolution. Conclusion Therapeutic choices can only be guided by assessments of patients' vital and functional prognosis. A sophisticated or even expensive device should be demanded for patients with favorable prognosis. For patients with precarious functional and vital prognosis, priority should be given to less Invasive techniques with immediate walking, The cost of the device should be correlated with patient's functional investment."
