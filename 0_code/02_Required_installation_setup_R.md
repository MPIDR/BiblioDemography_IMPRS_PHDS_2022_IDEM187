# 1. Required installation and set-up for R

The self-study session on network analysis presents code in R. For these to work (and to knit/compile the Rmarkdown file), you need to install the following libraries

```R
# install these if you do not have them

install.packages(c('knitr', 'rmarkdown','tidyverse','igraph')

```

## If you wish to follow the text analysis tutorial linked in slides (from Monica Alexander), you will need the following libraries

```R
# install these if you do not have them

install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "here", "tidytext", "topicmodels", "rvest"))

```
